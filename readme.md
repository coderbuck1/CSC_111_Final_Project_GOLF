Project description:

This project is designed to be a golf score card for 1-4 players who are playing at Old
Town Country Club in Winston-Salem. The goal of the scorecard is for each player to list
their name and then input the score that they got for each of the first 9 holes on the course.
The program shows a live scorecard of the hole number, the distance and par for the hole,
and the inputted score that the user typed in (all of the yardages and pars are accurate to the
real course). The program will then take the total score from each player and display it on the
score card, compared to the total par for the course. Additionally, the score card shows the
distance to the hole for each of the 3 tee locations on the course(white, blue, and black). The
score card was modeled after a paper scorecard used in golf and works just like we want it to work.

Instructions:

The user will 1. run the code 2. enter the number of players 3. Enter the names of each
player, and 4. Enter the scores for each player after each hole

Breakdown of effort/contributions made by each member of the group:

We did the whole project together in person. We worked from 1 computer as we found git
difficult to navigate with multiple collaborators. We believe that all 3 of us put in equal
effort for this project and we are very pleased with how it came out.
